# AStar-Algorithm-Unity

Disclaimer: This is a Unity project, so you will need Unity to run it...

Prerequisites: Terrain & 3D Models (like a Cube)

This is a simple implementation of the A* Algorithm in Unity. It is not the most efficient implementation, but it works.

If you like it, please leave a star ðŸŒŸ :)
